## How to use Kirby JSON-LD
1. Download the plugin and put in your Kirby plugin directory (e.g. `site/plugins/`)
2. Add your global publisher info to the Kirby config file (`site/config/config.php`) [recommended]
```
'chrfickinger.jsonld-for-kirby' => [
    'publisher' => [
    'type' => 'Organization/Person',
    'name' => 'Name',
    'logo' => 'Logo URL'
    ]
]
```
3. Add the block `jsonld` to a blueprint of your choice (e.g. `site/blueprints/pages/default.yml`). This allows to use as many blocks as needed on the page.
```yaml
jsonld:
    extends: jsonld
```
4. Add the following snippet to your output template or footer snippet. (e.g. `site/templates/default.php` or `site/snippets/footer.php`)
```php
<?php snippet('jsonld'); ?>
```
